ResonanceProbe: A EDA Driven Exploration of Audio Classification
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in audio classification refers to the process of examining and analyzing audio data to gain insights and understanding of its characteristics before building a classification model. EDA helps in identifying patterns, trends, anomalies, and other relevant features present in the audio dataset.
